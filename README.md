# pythoncli

I've wanted to build a CLI tool to stream-line my work-flow for a bit. Don't really know how these work, so I don't know what this is going to look like in the long run.

## Goals:

learn about CLIs and get inspired for later uses

sts-data-science:
    - Scrape raw html from the command line, and save it to a file maybe
    - might automate formatting scraped html (I'm assuming that would be a big project)
    - Be able to easily read, write, and prettify JSON files from the command line with ease

personal-management project:
    - I'm going to making a cli that tracks my transactions and helps me budget
