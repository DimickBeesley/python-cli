For when I'm wanting to review on how the argparse library works.



LINKS I'M LEARNING FROM:

How to Build Command Line Interfaces in Python With argparse:

CONTENTS (File purpose explanation):

Myls files:
    myls_1.py: if done without argparse
    myls_2.py: with argparse, no
    myls_3.py:

fromfile files:
    fromfile.py:
    args.py:

NOTES: 

There were more examples that we could have copied for
more files, but I think the examples were a little too 
niche for filling this folder, so here are the points
they covered:


you can set the number of values an option can consume
pos1 pos2 pos3 -opt
(the -opt can modified the first thre pos args)

you can set a default value if arg is missing
_ -opt
(there can be a pretend val that gets used if there isn't
a positional arg there already)

you can set the type of argument you want the -opt to modify

you can set a domain or a range of values the -opt can modify

you can set whether the an argument is required

you can give it a brief description of what an argument does

you can make arguments mutually exclusive

you can use the metavar param to set the name of the arg

you can set the name of the attributer to be added to the
parser object once everything has been parsed.
